# Sparx-bwk
**Sparx-Bookwork-Code** is a project ive been working on for about a year (mostly as a hobby).

Its a web scraper to log Bookwork codes for Sparx and auto completes Bookwork checks (explained [here](https://support.sparx.co.uk/en/knowledge/what-is-a-bookwork-check-and-why-are-they-used-in-sparx)). It uses chromedriver (google chrome) to grab the values of answers and codes. I chose to use python as its my main launguage and is easy to understand.

## Features
* auto fills in password + username
* logs bwc's for every question
* does bookwork checks.

## Setup
*


## Bugs
* Chromedriver needs updating about twice every month, you can download it [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
* Sometimes Auto Bookwork checks may not work (due to how fractions are displayed). 
* Make Sure that the .exe or .py file are in the same directory as the **Logs** file.

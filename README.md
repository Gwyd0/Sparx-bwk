# Sparx-bwk
Sparx-Bookwork-Code is a project ive been working on for about a year (mostly a hobby).

Its a web scraper to log Bookwork codes for Sparx and auto completes Bookwork checks. It uses chromedriver (google chrome) to grab the values of answers and codes. I chose to use python as its my main launguage and is easy to understand.

## Features
* auto fills in password + username
* logs bwc's for every question
* does bookwork checks.

## Setup



## Bugs
* Chromedriver needs updating about twice every month, you can download it here https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
